# Agent Orchestra Local LLM Router

**Production-grade agent orchestration with intelligent local-first model routing.**

This repository transforms the original Agent-orchestra-planner into a cost-effective, privacy-focused system that automatically selects the best model for each task - prioritizing local models while maintaining cloud fallback capabilities.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Local Models (Recommended)**: Install Ollama

   ```bash

# Install Ollama

curl -fsSL <https://ollama.ai/install.sh> | sh

# Pull some models

ollama pull llama3-8b-instruct
ollama pull qwen2.5-3b-instruct

1. **Python Environment**: Python 3.11+

   ```bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Installation

1. **Clone and Setup**:

   ```bash

git clone <repo-url>
cd agent-orchestra-local-llm-router
cp q-and-a-orchestra-agent/.env.example q-and-a-orchestra-agent/.env

1. **Configure Environment**:

   ```bash

# Edit .env file

MODEL_ROUTING_MODE=local-preferred
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=<http://localhost:11434>

# Optional cloud keys for fallback

ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here

1. **Start the Service**:

   ```bash

cd q-and-a-orchestra-agent

# For development (with security)

./scripts/start_dev.sh

# Or directly

python main_v2.py

## 💡 What This Does

### 🎯 Core Capabilities

#### 1️⃣ Intelligent Model Routing

Automatically selects the best model for each task based on:

- **Task requirements** (QA, planning, coding, etc.)
- **Cost preferences** (local-first, balanced, performance)
- **Context size** and **capability needs**
- **Budget constraints** and **usage patterns**

#### 2️⃣ Multi-Provider Support

Seamlessly works with:

- **Local Models**: Ollama (Llama, Qwen, Mistral, etc.)
- **Cloud Models**: Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, Moonshot, etc.
- **Generic OpenAI-compatible APIs**: Custom endpoints

#### 3️⃣ Cost-Aware Orchestration

- **Local-first routing** to minimize costs
- **Budget tracking** and spending limits
- **Usage analytics** and cost optimization
- **Dry-run mode** for planning without execution

## 📖 How to Use

### Basic Pattern

1. **Describe what you need** (be specific about your stack)
2. **Claude plans the approach** (shows architecture, confirms direction)
3. **Claude builds it** (creates files, writes code, adds tests)
4. **You iterate** (refine, add features, adjust)

### Example Conversations

#### Building a Multi-Agent System

```text
You: I need a continuous deployment system with multiple agents:
     - Code checker validates commits
     - Test runner executes test suites
     - Deployer pushes to staging
     - Monitor watches for errors
     My stack: Python, GitHub Actions, GCP, MCP for tool access

Claude: I'll build a 4-agent orchestration system. Here's the architecture:
        [shows agent topology, message flow, MCP integration]
        
        Starting with:
        1. Agent role definitions
        2. Message schemas  
        3. Implementation code
        4. Safety mechanisms
        
        Sound good?

You: Yes, but add approval gates for production deploys

Claude: [creates complete system with approval gates]

#### Creating a Full-Stack App

You: Build a workflow automation dashboard:
     - Frontend: Electron app with React
     - Backend: Python FastAPI
     - Database: Postgres on Neon
     - Features: Create workflows, view execution history, real-time logs

Claude: I'll create a complete 3-tier app. Structure:
        - Frontend: Electron + React + TypeScript
        - Backend: FastAPI with 11 REST endpoints + WebSocket
        - Database: 9 tables with proper indexes

        I'll include:
        - JWT authentication
        - Real-time updates via WebSocket
        - Database migrations
        - Docker deployment
        
        Proceed?

You: Yes, and add support for multiple LLM providers

Claude: [creates complete app with Claude + OpenAI integration]

#### Refactoring Messy Code

You: This planner.py has no error handling and the executor.py crashes
     constantly. Also need CI/CD and proper secrets management.

Claude: I'll refactor both files and add operational infrastructure:

        Improvements:
        1. planner.py - retry logic, circuit breaker, validation
        2. executor.py - timeout management, metrics, resource cleanup
        3. CI/CD pipeline - testing, security scanning, canary deployment
        4. Secrets - AWS Secrets Manager + Vault support
        5. Migration plan - 7 weeks with rollback procedures
        
        Each phase has rollback capability. Start?

You: Yes, show me the refactored planner first

Claude: [shows improved planner with comprehensive error handling]

---

## 🎨 Advanced Features

### Dry-Run Mode

Preview plans before execution:

```text
You: Show me what deploying to production would do, but don't execute yet

Claude: [generates complete plan with steps, timing, costs, risks]

Claude: [generates complete plan with steps, timing, costs, risks]

### Cost Awareness

Track and estimate cloud costs:

You: What will this system cost to run?

Claude: Estimated monthly costs:
        - Cloud Run: $2.50/day ($75/month)
        - Database: $15/month
        - LLM calls: ~$50/month (1000 requests)
        Total: ~$140/month

### Multi-Turn Context

Build iteratively without repeating yourself:

You: Add error handling to the planner

Claude: [adds error handling]

You: Now add metrics collection

Claude: [adds metrics, remembers context from earlier changes]

You: Update the README to document these features

Claude: [updates README based on all previous changes]

## 📋 Best Practices

### Get Better Results

**Do:**

- ✅ Specify your exact stack upfront
- ✅ Share constraints (timeline, budget, must-haves)
- ✅ Build incrementally (MVP → features → polish)
- ✅ Ask for explanations of architecture decisions
- ✅ Request dry-run for high-stakes operations

**Don't:**

- ❌ Use vague descriptions ("build an app")
- ❌ Mix unrelated requests in one message
- ❌ Expect perfection on first attempt (iterate!)
- ❌ Skip validation of critical operations

### Example: Specific vs Vague

**Vague:**
> "Build me a chatbot"

**Specific:**
> "Build a customer support chatbot using FastAPI backend with Claude API, React frontend, Postgres for conversation history. Needs JWT auth and should handle 100 concurrent users."

The specific version will get you production-ready code immediately.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Issue:** "Claude isn't using the skill"

- **Solution:** Be more specific about your task (mention "multi-agent", "full-stack", or "refactor")

**Issue:** "Code doesn't match my stack"

- **Solution:** State your exact stack upfront: "Using FastAPI 0.109, Python 3.11, Postgres 15"

**Issue:** "Too much code at once"

- **Solution:** Request incremental: "Start with just the database schema" then build up

**Issue:** "Want to see plan first"

- **Solution:** Request dry-run: "Show me what you'll build before implementing"
